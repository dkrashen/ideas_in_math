Syllabus and Course Structure
---

**Welcome to Ideas in Mathematics!**


Material
---

This course is intended as an introduction to mathematical thinking and the use
of mathematics across a range of human experiences. We will ask the question of
what mathematics is, what it does, its history and modern development, the
culture and practice of mathematics as a discipline, and how it relates to
science and engineering. 

Lectures
---

- Lectures will be in person in David Rittenhouse Laboratory
- In class worksheets will be assigned during most lectures, but can be excused
  in case you are not able to attend a lecture due to illness or other valid
  reasons (let me know by email if this happens)

Course Structure
---

- Lectures on Tuesday and Thursdays 3:30-5:00pm in DRL A1
- Weekly reading assigned on Thursdays and due the following week on Tuesday
- In class worksheets
- Weekly homework sets assigned on Fridays and due the following week on Fridays (online via canvas/gradescope)
- 3 in class exams during the semester

In the lectures, I will assume that all students have done the assigned reading. I will try to supplement the material by adding extra details and examples as needed.

Grading
---

The course grade will be as follows:

- in class worksheets: 30% total (drop up to 6)
- weekly worksheets: 40% total (drop up do 3)
- monthly worksheets: 30% total (drop up do 1)

Grading concerns must be presented to me in writing within one week of when the worksheets are graded.

All work must meet the standards of the [University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Code of
Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/). Lack of knowledge of these policies does not excuse a
violation. Working together is allowed (and encouraged) on worksheets, but all
work should stand alone.


How to be successful
---

To be successful in the course will require:

- Keeping up with readings in the textbook,
- Attending the lectures/discussions
- Keeping up with the written assignments,
- Asking questions via written assignments, email or during office hours
  whenever something is unclear.

In practical terms, if you want to do well in the course, it is absolutely
essential that you keep up with the material in a timely way. Late homework
will generally not be accepted.
